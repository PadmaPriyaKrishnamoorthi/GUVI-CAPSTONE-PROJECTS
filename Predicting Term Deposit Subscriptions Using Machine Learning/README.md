Predicting Term Deposit Subscriptions Using Machine Learning

Problem Statement:
Your client is a retail banking institution. Term deposits are a major source of income for the bank. A term deposit is a cash investment held at a financial institution for an agreed rate of interest over a fixed term. The bank employs various outreach plans to sell term deposits to their customers, including email marketing, advertisements, telephonic marketing, and digital marketing. Telephonic marketing campaigns remain one of the most effective ways to reach out to people but require significant investment due to the large call centers needed to execute these campaigns. Therefore, it is crucial to identify customers most likely to convert beforehand so they can be specifically targeted via call. Given client data such as age, job type, marital status, and information about the call such as duration, day, and month, your task is to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit.

Business Use Cases:
Targeted Marketing: Optimize telephonic marketing campaigns by identifying clients most likely to subscribe to term deposits.
Cost Efficiency: Reduce marketing costs by focusing resources on high-probability customers.
Increased Revenue: Boost term deposit subscriptions through more effective customer targeting.
Customer Relationship Management: Improve customer relationships by offering relevant financial products.



Approach:
Data Collection: Use the provided datasets (train.csv and test.csv) containing client and call details.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
Feature Engineering: Generate additional features that may improve model performance, such as interaction terms or aggregated statistics.
Model Building: Train various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate models using accuracy as the primary metric. Use cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model performance through techniques like Grid Search and Random Search.
Prediction: Use the best-performing model to predict the likelihood of new clients subscribing to term deposits.
Submission: Save predictions in the prescribed format and validate accuracy using solution_checker.xlsx.
Results:
The final model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the validation dataset.
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score values were YY%, ZZ%, and AA%, respectively, indicating the model's effectiveness in predicting term deposit subscriptions.
Project Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy: The primary metric for evaluating the model's performance.
Precision: Proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
Recall (Sensitivity): Proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives.
F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric for model evaluation.
