Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis:
Detecting Hate Speech in Tweets Using Machine Learning

Problem Statement:

The objective of this task is to detect hate speech in tweets. For the sake of simplicity, we say a tweet contains hate speech if it has a racist or sexist sentiment associated with it. So, the task is to classify racist or sexist tweets from other tweets. Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, your objective is to predict the labels on the test dataset.

Business Use Cases:
Content Moderation: Automated detection of hate speech can assist social media platforms in moderating content, ensuring a safer online environment.
User Safety: Early identification of harmful speech can help prevent escalation to physical actions, protecting individuals and communities.
Legal Compliance: Helps companies comply with legal regulations regarding hate speech and avoid potential fines and legal actions.
Brand Protection: Safeguards the brandâ€™s reputation by preventing the spread of hateful content associated with their platform.

Approach:

Data Collection: Use the provided dataset of tweets for training and testing. The dataset is split into a 65:35 ratio for training and testing, respectively.
Data Preprocessing: Clean the tweet text by removing URLs, special characters, and stop words. Tokenize the text and convert it to a suitable format for modeling.
Feature Engineering: Generate features using techniques like TF-IDF, word embeddings, and sentiment analysis.
Model Building: Train various classification models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and deep learning models like LSTM and BERT.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Use cross-validation to ensure robustness.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model performance through techniques like Grid Search and Random Search.
Prediction: Use the best-performing model to predict the labels on the test dataset.
Results:
The final model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test dataset.
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score values were YY%, ZZ%, and AA% respectively, indicating the model's effectiveness in detecting hate speech.
Project Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy: Measures the overall correctness of the model.
Precision: Indicates the proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.
Recall (Sensitivity): Measures the ability of the model to identify all relevant instances.
F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric for model evaluation.
