Forecasting Bike Rental Demand Using Machine Learning

Problem Statement:
In this project, you are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast hourly bike rental demand.

Business Use Cases:
Operational Efficiency: Improve the allocation and distribution of bikes across different stations to meet demand efficiently.
Inventory Management: Optimize bike maintenance schedules and reduce downtime by predicting demand accurately.
Revenue Optimization: Enhance pricing strategies based on predicted demand to maximize revenue.
Urban Planning: Provide insights for city planners to improve infrastructure and bike-sharing station placements.

Approach:
Data Collection: Use the provided datasets (train.csv and test.csv) containing weather-related features and bike rental counts.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
Feature Engineering: Generate additional features from the data, such as time-based features (hour, day of the week, month) and weather-related interactions.
Model Building: Train various regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate models using Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) as the primary metric. Use cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model performance through techniques like Grid Search and Random Search.
Prediction: Use the best-performing model to predict the count of total rentals for each hour during the next 6 months.
Submission: Save predictions in the prescribed format and validate RMSLE using solution_checker.xlsx.

Results:
The final model achieved an RMSLE of XX on the validation dataset.
The model effectively captured hourly rental patterns and weather influences, providing accurate rental demand forecasts.

Project Evaluation Metrics:
Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE): The primary metric for evaluating the model's performance, focusing on the relative error between predicted and actual rental counts.
